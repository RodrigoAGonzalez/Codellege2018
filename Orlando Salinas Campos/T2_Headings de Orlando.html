<h2> Relevant aspects </h2>
<h3> Funny Story </h3>
    <p> When I was 19 years old, I used to work at teleperfomance. <br />
      one day I was heading on the main entrance and there was a construction
      site on the building, because of that same reason there was a
      glass door that was not place within the bulding before and I did not
      see it, because of that I hit my head with the glass door before I was
      able to react to it being on my face and the whole glass came down as
      if a car ran into it. fortunately I did not suffer any injuries. </p>
<h3> My last vacations </h3>

    <p> During my last vacations I went to sixflags in Illinois, I was there for
      only 1 day and the waiting lines to get inside the games lasted minimum 40
      minutes, but it was worth the waiting.  </p>
